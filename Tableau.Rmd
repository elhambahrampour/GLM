In this project, we show an example of a dashboard focusing on the average of body mass index (BMI). There is an overview of the distribution of individuals' BMI from the NHANES program.  
Various factors such as physical activity, gender, location, marital status, education level, and income have been shown to summarize the average of BMI. 

## Goal

The purpose of the dashboard is to view the most important metrics and results at a glance. Generally, dashboards are an interactive way to see how the project or program perform.

## Result

By using this dashboard, you will discover the distribution of the expected individuals' BMI in an easy way. You can apply filters yourself and consult different graphs. By immediately having the right information available, correct inference and decisions can be made.
